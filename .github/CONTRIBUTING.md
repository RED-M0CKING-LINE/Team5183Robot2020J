### Committing:

- Do not commit to the Stable branch ever. The stable branch is for pull requests from the master branch only of tested code.

<br/>

### Pull Requests:

- The master branch is unstable code and is not guaranteed to work. Please clone from the Stable branch if you plan on using any part of this code.

<br/>

### Releases:

- Only release code from the Stable branch after it has been tested. If this is not the case, mark it as a pre-release
- Code should be released before and after a competition.
- Version numbers will follow the following format from here on out: YYYY.MM.DD
- The release title should be something approprate like "Pre-Alpena Competiton" or "Post-Alpena Competition"
- The release description should have the following:
    - A synopsis of the codebase and any notices that are deemed appropriate
    - a list of key features and implimentations. Be sure to include what technology the feature uses. Ex. "Gyroscope" should be something like "ADIS16448 IMU - Gyro, Accel, Temp, Mag, Pressure." or "FRC SPI Gryo"
