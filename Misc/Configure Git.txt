The following commands are for configuring the git VCS with the help of VS Code.

Run the following Commands

	git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"

	git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"

	git config --global credential.helper store

Check your config with the following command
	git config --list

Then, next time you wish to push changes it will have you login, but this will only happen once. Login and you're done!

You may need to initalize the repository you wish to use. Google it. "how to initalize git repositories"
